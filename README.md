# ðŸš€ My Placement Journey Repository  

Welcome to my **Placement Journey Repository**! This repository contains all the programs, projects, and problem-solving code that I practiced during my placement preparation. It includes **Java, HTML, JavaScript, C, and CSS**â€”each with its own set of implementations, concepts, and projects.

Whether you're revising for interviews or looking for structured placement preparation material, this repository has valuable resources.
